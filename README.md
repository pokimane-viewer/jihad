## Description

This module defines two functions:

1. **`explain_allahu_akbar()`**  
   Returns a breakdown of the common phrase *Allahu Akbar* (“God is greatest”), its meaning, and typical contexts of usage.

2. **`explain_jihad_and_hypocrisy()`**  
   Explains the multifaceted concept of *jihad* (“struggle or striving”) and contrasts its ethical principles with real‑world hypocrisy, such as government actors denying cyberattacks.
